The idea of this repository is to automatically detect if certain passwords were leaked.

To detect for leaked passwords I use [k-anonymity](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByPassword).
To gather passwords from firefox I used/purged [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/master/firefox_decrypt.py).
Chrome data coming soon.
